The **HtmlToPdf feature** of the `Westwind.WebView` library provides a quick way to print Html to Pdf on Windows. It uses the WebView2 Control in headless mode that doesn't require any UI. It can be run from any Windows .NET application, including non-UI and service applications and IIS. 

> Because Html To Pdf generation uses the built-in Windows WebView2 Runtime and SDK, there are no large dependencies required to use it unlike other tools.

Pdf output can be generated from:

* An HTML Url
* An HTML File on disk

Output can be generated to:

* File
* Stream

Using the following callback methods:

* Using an Async Call
* Using Event Callbacks 

The library uses the built-in **WebView2 Runtime in Windows so it has no external dependencies for your applications** assuming you are running on a recent version of Windows that has the WebView2 Runtime installed. 

> #### Server Unattended Usage Requires Special Consideration
> HtmlToPdf generation works in server environments, but there is one limitation in that you cannot generate a table of contents at the moment. There's a server specific configuration that must be set in order to run inside of a service environment like IIS or as a Windows Service. For more info [see below](#unattended-server-operation-iis-windows-services-etc).

If you would like to find out more how this library works and how the original code and Pdf code was build, you can check out this blog post:

* [Programmatic Html to Pdf Generation using the WebView2 Control](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Mar/26/Programmatic-Html-to-PDF-Generation-using-the-WebView2-Control-with-NET)

## Prerequisites
The library is Windows specific and works with:

### Support for
* Windows 11/10 Server 2019/2022
* Desktop Applications
* Console Applications
* Service Applications

The component does not support:

* Non Windows platforms

### Targets

* net9.0-windows
* net8.0-windows
* net472

### Dependencies
Deployed applications have the following dependencies:  

* [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH&ch=1#download)  
On recent updates of Windows 11 and 10, the WebView is pre-installed as a system component. On Servers however, you may have to explicitly install the WebView Runtime.

* [Windows Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  
The WebView2 component is dependent on Windows Desktop Runtime libraries and therefore requires the Desktop runtime to be installed **even for server applications**. On Server OS versions the WebView2 runtime has to be explicitly installed as it's not pre-installed by Windows.

## Using the library
This library only has a single dependency on the WebView control and provides very fast base Html to PDF conversion. 

You can install this NuGet package:

```ps
dotnet add package westwind.webview
```

The library exposes 4 separate output methods:

* PrintToPdfStreamAsync() - Runs async and returns a `result.ResultStream`
* PrintToPdfAsync() - Runs async and creates a PDF output file
* PrintToPdfStream() - Creates a PDF and returns it via Callbacks in `result.ResultStream` 
* PrintToPdf()  - Creates a PDF to file a notifies completion via Callback

All of the methods take a file or Url as input. File names have to be fully qualified with a path. Output to file requires that you provide a filename.

All requests return a `PdfPrintResult` structure which has a `IsSuccess` flag you can check. For stream results, the `ResultStream` property will be set with a `MemoryStream` instance on success. Errors can use the `Message` or `LastException` to retrieve error information.

### Async Call Syntax for Stream Result

```cs
var outputFile = Path.GetFullPath(@".\test3.pdf");
var htmlFile = Path.GetFullPath("HtmlSampleFileLonger-SelfContained.html");

var host = new HtmlToPdfHost()
{
    BackgroundHtmlColor = "#ffffff"
};
host.CssAndScriptOptions.KeepTextTogether = true;            

var pdfPrintSettings = new WebViewPrintSettings()
{
    // margins are 0.4F default
    MarginTop = 0.5,
    MarginBottom = 0.3F,
    ScaleFactor = 0.9F,   // 1 is default

    ShouldPrintHeaderAndFooter = true,
    HeaderTitle = "Custom Header (centered)",
    FooterText = "Custom Footer (lower right)",

    // Optionally customize the header and footer completely - WebView syntax                
    // HeaderTemplate = "<div style='text-align:center; font-size: 12px;'>" + 
    //                  "<span class='title'></span></div>",
    // FooterTemplate = "<div style='text-align:right; margin-right: 2em'>" + 
    //                  "<span class='pageNumber'></span> of " +
    //                  "<span class='totalPages'></span></div>",

    GenerateDocumentOutline = true  // default
};

// We're interested in result.ResultStream
var result = await host.PrintToPdfStreamAsync(htmlFile, pdfPrintSettings);

Assert.IsTrue(result.IsSuccess, result.Message);
Assert.IsNotNull(result.ResultStream); // THIS

// Copy resultstream to output file
File.Delete(outputFile);
using (var fstream = new FileStream(outputFile, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write))
{
    result.ResultStream.CopyTo(fstream);
    result.ResultStream.Close(); // Close returned stream!
}
ShellUtils.OpenUrl(outputFile);
```

### Async Stream Example in a Web Application

```csharp
[HttpGet("rawpdf")]
public async Task<IActionResult> RawPdf()
{
    // source file or URL to render to Pdf
    var file = Path.GetFullPath("./HtmlSampleFile-SelfContained.html");

    var pdf = new HtmlToPdfHost();
    var pdfResult = await pdf.PrintToPdfStreamAsync(file, new WebViewPrintSettings {  PageRanges = "1-10"});

    if (pdfResult == null || !pdfResult.IsSuccess)
    {
        Response.StatusCode = 500;                
        return new JsonResult(new
        {
            isError = true,
            message = pdfResult.Message
        });
    }

    return new FileStreamResult(pdfResult.ResultStream, "application/pdf");             
}
```

### Async Call Syntax for File Output

```csharp
// Url or full qualified file path
var htmlFile = Path.GetFullPath("HtmlSampleFileLonger-SelfContained.html");
var outputFile = Path.GetFullPath(@".\test2.pdf");
File.Delete(outputFile);

var host = new HtmlToPdfHost(); // or new HtmlToPdfHostExtended()
var result = await host.PrintToPdfAsync(htmlFile, outputFile);

Assert.IsTrue(result.IsSuccess, result.Message);
ShellUtils.OpenUrl(outputFile);  // display the Pdf file you specified
```


### Callback Syntax to Pdf File

```csharp
var htmlFile = Path.GetFullPath("HtmlSampleFile-SelfContained.html");
var outputFile = Path.GetFullPath(@".\test.pdf");
File.Delete(outputFile);

var host = new HtmlToPdfHost();            

// Callback when complete
var onPrintComplete = (PdfPrintResult result) =>
{
    if (result.IsSuccess)
    {
        ShellUtils.OpenUrl(outputFile);
        Assert.IsTrue(true);
    }
    else
    {
        Assert.Fail(result.Message);
    }
};
var pdfPrintSettings = new WebViewPrintSettings()
{
    // default margins are 0.4F
    MarginBottom = 0.2F,
    MarginLeft = 0.2f,
    MarginRight = 0.2f,
    MarginTop = 0.4f,
    ScaleFactor = 0.8f,
    PageRanges = "1,2,5-7"
};
host.PrintToPdf(htmlFile, outputFile, onPrintComplete, pdfPrintSettings);

// make sure app keeps running
```

### Event Syntax to Stream

```csharp
// File or URL
var htmlFile = Path.GetFullPath("HtmlSampleFile-SelfContained.html");                       
var host = new HtmlToPdfHost();

// Callback on completion
var onPrintComplete = (PdfPrintResult result) =>
{
    if (result.IsSuccess)
    {
        // create file so we can display
        var outputFile = Path.GetFullPath(@".\test1.pdf");
        File.Delete(outputFile);

        using var fstream = new FileStream(outputFile, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write);
        result.ResultStream.CopyTo(fstream);

        result.ResultStream.Close(); // Close returned stream!

        ShellUtils.OpenUrl(outputFile);
        Assert.IsTrue(true);
    }
    else
    {
        Assert.Fail(result.Message);
    }
};
var pdfPrintSettings = new WebViewPrintSettings()
{
    MarginBottom = 0.2F,
    MarginLeft = 0.2f,
    MarginRight = 0.2f,
    MarginTop = 0.4f,
    ScaleFactor = 0.8f,
};
host.PrintToPdfStream(htmlFile, onPrintComplete, pdfPrintSettings);

// make sure app keeps running
```

The `Task` based methods are easiest to use so that's the recommended syntax. The callback based methods are there so you can more easily use this if you are running in a non-async and can't easily transition to async. 

Both approaches run on a separate STA thread to ensure that the WebView can run regardless of whether you are running inside of an application that has a main UI/STA thread and it works inside of Windows Service contexts.

## Unattended Server Operation (IIS, Windows Services etc.)
HtmlToPdf generation is supported in unattended mode, but there are some requirements and limitations in this environment. 

![Running Under IIS](Assets/RunningUnderIIS.png)

Requirements and limitations:

* Table of Content Generation is not supported (no DevTools operation)
* File output may not be supported (depending on permissions)
* Application has to be set for server operation on startup

Before looking at some of the limitations and requirements lets look at how you can use this library in ASP.NET Core.

### Running HtmlToPdf in ASP.NET
You can look at the [AspNetSample](/AspNetSample) which contains an ASP.NET Core test project that demonstrates Web usage. To see the permissions issues though you have to run IIS using a default or non-interactive account.

To return a PDF as a document in a Controller:

```csharp
[HttpGet("rawpdf")]
public async Task<IActionResult> RawPdf()
{
    var file = Path.GetFullPath("./HtmlSampleFile-SelfContained.html");

    var pdf = new HtmlToPdfHost();
    var pdfResult = await pdf.PrintToPdfStreamAsync(file, new WebViewPrintSettings {  PageRanges = "1-10"});

    if (pdfResult == null || !pdfResult.IsSuccess)
    {
        Response.StatusCode = 500;                
        return new JsonResult(new
        {
            isError = true,
            message = pdfResult.Message
        });
    }

    return new FileStreamResult(pdfResult.ResultStream, "application/pdf"); 
}
```

Typically you'll want to print to stream so no files are created on disk. You can also write to file and store the output, but make sure you have adequate permissions to write in the target location.

### Server vs. non-Server Operation
This library by default runs in non-server mode and uses the W**ebView2 DevTools Protocol** to print PDF files. For server mode it uses the  WebView's built in PDF generation that's also used by actual Chromium browser UIs.

The difference between these two APIs is that the DevTools API provides a few additional features not available in the built-in print API - most notably for this library the PDF Table Of Contents generation. 

> #### Server Limitations
> Unfortunately the DevTools API currently does not work in unattended, non-active-desktop environments and so this library falls back to the WebView functionality.
> 
> Therefore:
>
> Server Operation **does not** support the auto generated PDF Table of Contents

### Configure for running in Server Mode
In order to run in 'server' mode you need to configure the application during startup (before any PDF generation). This effectively involves setting the `HtmlToPdfDefaults.UseServerPdfGeneration = true`.

You can do this in two ways:

* Setting the variable directly in your server startup code
* Calling `HtmlToPdfDefaults.ServerPreInitialize()`   <small>*(recommended)*</small>

`ServerPreInitialize()` sets the server flag, and also runs a small empty document dummy PDF generation to prime the PDF engine for faster startup. This also fixes an occasional issue with first time rendering of PDF output.

```cs
// Program.cs
...

var webViewEnvPath = Path.GetFullPath("WebViewEnvironment")
HtmlToPdfDefaults.ServerPreInitialize(webViewEnvPath);

// alternately set just  
// HtmlToPdfDefaults.UseServerPdfGeneration = true;

// preferably before builder.Build() is called
 var app = builder.Build();
```

### Permissions
But as is always the case when you run in a server environment, you have to make sure you have the right permissions to access the files you want to convert and if you're generating to a file that  you have write access. Generally you'll want to generate to stream to avoid having to write files to disk

#### WebView Environment Permissions
The code above specifies an explicit path for the WebView environment. By default the `%TEMP%` folder is used, but in server environments there may be no temp folder for some accounts like the ApplicationPoolIdentity. So you can specify a path here.

I've found that you can write into your content root and that works even when running with IIS Application Pool Identity (which is odd, but it works for me). Your mileage may vary.
